                    Your mom is frustrated by her propensity to lose slips of
                    paper with writing on them, specifically her shopping lists.
                    She knows that you're a really smart web developer and
                    assumes that you can easily make her a website to keep track
                    of her shopping list.

                <h3>Project Requirements Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, write a simple shopping
                    list app. There must be an input box to add new items, and
                    an [x] button to delete items. The data does not have to
                    persist a page refresh (because there's no API right now).
                </p>
                <p>Here's what the list might look like:</p>

                    to start your project. This code will help you understand
                    any patterns you should use when completing this assignment.

                        commented out before moving on to part 2.

                        Write an event listener that listens for a

                        refresh that happens on submits.

                    <li>
                        Be able to log the string the user types into the input
                        box to the console after the submit. Keep the console
                        open and look often for JS errors there.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use the three steps of creating a new element.

                                edit properties like <code>textContent</code> or
