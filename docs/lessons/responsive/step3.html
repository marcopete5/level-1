                    In this age of mobile devices the developer has to account
                    for their product being viewed on a hand held or tablet
                    sized device as well as laptops and desktops. This means
                    your site should look great on any size screen!

                    is an example of a website that does not adapt to screen

                    of your browser and shrink it to phone size...notice how
                    none of the elements reposition and much of the information
                    is offscreen because of it? This makes users very unhappy.)

                <p>
                    Responsive web design is an approach to web design aimed at
                    making your sites content look great on all screen sizes.

                    These days, all web apps should be created with this
                    approach.

                <h3>Media queries</h3>
                <p>
                    A media query is a fancy way of asking "How wide is the
                    window." We can also query to check if our device is in
                    landscape mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's almost like writing an <code>if</code> statement for
                    your CSS.
                </p>
                <p>In our CSS, we could have the line:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
@media (max-width: 500px)&#123;&#125;

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This is like saying, <code>if</code> the screen(or window of
                    the browser) is less than 500px. We write the
                    <code>then</code> part of the if-then statement in brackets.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
@media (orientation: landscape) &#123;
    .my-class &#123;
        color: red;
    &#125;
&#125;

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This one is saying: <code>If</code> the device in in
                    landscape <code>then</code> turn .my-class red.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This example is arbitrary, but we could see how it would be
                    nice to show certain wider content when in landscape, and
                    hide it while our phone or tablet is in held upright.
                </p>
                <p>These work with <code>and</code> statements as well...</p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
@media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 800px) &#123;
  html &#123; background: red; &#125;
&#125;

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    So the screen must have a minimum width of 600 pixels AND a
                    maximum width no greater than 800 pixels in order to run the
                    code inside of the &#123;&#125;'s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Media queries also work with <code>or</code> statements...
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
@media (max-width: 600px), (min-width: 800px) &#123;
  html &#123; background: red; &#125;
&#125;

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Notice we use a "," rather than <code>or</code>, that is
                    because the above statement will actually be read as two
                    different media queries, but for the sake of understanding
                    you can view this as a simple or statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we might have several media queries to cover the many
                    different size screens our site might be viewed on. We might
                    have one for phone sized screens, one for tablets and one
                    for laptops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is sudo-code (not actual code, but an english
                    approximation of the code) as an example:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
if (phone size) do this &#123;&#125;
if (tablet size) do this &#123;&#125;
if (larger than tablet) do this &#123;&#125;

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Let's now break down the two phrases you will see most
                    often...<code>max-width</code> and
                    <code>min-width</code> and how to remember which does what.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When using media queries we are checking to see if the
                    screen size is between 0 and infinity but we will substitute
                    <code>min-width</code>, if we have it, for the first number
                    and <code>max-width</code>, if we have it, for the second
                    number.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
0 through infinity
        -or-
min-width through max-width

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    So, if we only have a <code>min-width</code> of 230px we are
                    checking to see if our screen size is between
                    min-width(230px) and infinity (we could say 10,000 if that
                    helps).
                </p>
                <p><code>230px through 10,000px</code></p>
                <p>
                    If our screen size was 650px width would the following media
                    query would be true or false?
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
@media (min-width: 100px)&#123;...&#125;

</code></pre>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
@media (min-width: 100px)&#123;...&#125; // 650 -> true

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Our screen size of 650px is between min-width (100) and
                    infinity so the above code in &#123;...&#125; will run.
                </p>
                <p>Here is another:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
@media (max-width: 600px)&#123;...&#125;

</code></pre>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
@media (max-width: 600px)&#123;...&#125; //650 -> false

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    In the above we are checking to see if our screen size
                    (650px) is between 0 and <code>max-width</code>... 0 - 600.
                    650 is not between them so the code in the
                    <code>&#123;...&#125;</code> will not run.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
@media (min-width: 601) and (max-width: 850px)&#123;...&#125;

</code></pre>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
@media (min-width: 601) and (max-width: 850px)&#123;...&#125; // 650px -> true

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    We are checking to see if our screen size (650px) is between
                    min-width and <code>max-width</code> which translates to:
                    601 - 850. 650 is between those two numbers so the
                    <code>&#123;...&#125;</code> will run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's get a bit more complicated now. If our screen size is
                    650px what color will our background be?
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
@media only screen and (min-width: 640px)  &#123;background: blue&#125;
@media only screen and (min-width: 479px)  &#123;background: red&#125;

</code></pre>
                <p>You guessed it! Red!</p>
                <p>
                    Why? Because both media queries are true and so first the
                    screen will be turned blue by the first query (too fast to
                    see), then it will be turned red by the second. And red it
                    will stay. (Unless acted upon later in our CSS!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose we wanted the first (background: blue) to apply to
                    any screen size over 640?
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
@media only screen and (min-width: 640px)  &#123;background: blue&#125;
@media only screen and (min-width: 479px), (max-width: 639px) &#123;background: red&#125;

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    We added (max-width) to the second to give it a range. Thus
                    the first will handle anything between min-width and
                    infinity (10,000) so...640 - 10,000. And the second would be
                    between min-width(479) and max-width (639) so...479 - 639.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
479 - 639 --> red
640 - 10,000 --> blue

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Note: I've used 10,000 as infinity to make it easier to read
                    only. Infinity is, of course, not 10,000.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: <code>only screen</code> is made of two recognized key
                    words, the first only is a keyword not recognized by older
                    browsers and will keep this block of CSS from running on
                    them. The second screen is saying if we are printing to a
                    screen rather than email or printer, etc. then do the
                    following code.

                    is a link with the various sizes of common devices including
                    Apple Watches, various phones, general rules for
                    laptops/desktops (because there are so many) and tablets.

                <p>
                    Let's look at some mobile first examples (because you should
                    ALWAYS design for mobile first):
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
// This applies from 0px to 600px
body &#123;
  background: red;
&#125;

</code></pre>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
// This applies from 600px onwards
@media (min-width: 600px) &#123;
  body &#123;
    background: green;
  &#125;
&#125;

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This accounts for only two sizes, but that is still better
                    than accounting for only one, much better.
                </p>
                <p>Here is a larger, or rather more detailed, example:</p>

                    Note: Bootstrap (the framework) uses media queries so while
                    you will find that Bootstrap might be an easier choice to
                    create responsive websites, you need to understand Media
                    Queries to understand Bootstrap.

                <p>
                    Mobile First is a popular design practice. This means that
                    we design for phones and small screens first.
                </p>
                <p>This helps our content load quicker on small screes.</p>
                <p>
                    Instead of using <code>max</code> as in
                    <code>@media only screen and (max-width: 750px)</code> we
                    use <code>min</code>.

                    You will often see, and will more than likely want to

                    Media queries will overrule general CSS written outside of a
                    media query block. So in both of the follow cases, the
                    background color would be blue with the screen was less than
                    500px wide.
