                    Understanding the CSS box model will help you more as a web
                    designer than just about any one other thing in CSS. Once
                    you understand the difference between inline and block-level
                    elements, the box model will begin to be easier to
                    understand. Each concept is fairly straightforward to
                    understand, so we'll work through a number of examples to
                    illustrate the different pieces of the box model.

                <h3>Analogy</h3>
                <p>Imagine yourself inside of a bubble suit or a sumo suit:</p>
                <p>
                    <img
                        class="image-embed"
                        src="https://coursework.vschool.io/content/images/2016/08/6ycugupg64-635576098981616250-370x208.jpg"
                        alt="Person in a bubble suit, illustrating the CSS box model analogy" />
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll be referring to this concept throughout this lesson.
                    Now check the diagram below:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img
                        class="image-embed"
                        src="https://coursework.vschool.io/content/images/2016/08/boxmodel.gif"
                        alt="Diagram of the CSS box model showing content, padding, border, and margin" />
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the diagram you can see each piece of the box model:
                    <code>height/width</code>, <code>padding</code>,
                    <code>border</code>, and <code>margin</code>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <hr class="section-divider" />

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Height/Width</h3>
                <p>
                    The height and width of an element is the amount of space
                    the content of the element itself takes up. This is not
                    necessarily the same as how much space the whole element
                    takes up. In the bubble suit analogy, this is represented by
                    <em>how much space your actual body takes up</em>. The
                    dimensions of the content can be set by the CSS
                    <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> While this <em>can</em> be set in the
                    HTML on many elements, this is a bad idea and should be
                    avoided
                </p>
            </div>

            <hr class="section-divider" />

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Padding</h3>
                <p>
                    An element's <strong>padding</strong> can be thought of as
                    the additional space the bubble suit adds to the total
                    amount of space you occupy. If there is no padding, it would
                    be like the bubble suit were vacuumed to your body with no
                    additional air between the plastic bubble material and your
                    clothes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The element's padding is still considered part of the
                    element itself, so as the padding increases, the element
                    gets larger and larger. We can see this with a span element:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
&lt;span class="no-padding"&gt;I'm skinny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="with-padding"&gt;I'm fat&lt;/span&gt;

</code></pre>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
span {
    background-color: #FF4F33;
    color: #F4FEFF;
    border: none;
}

.no-padding {
    padding: 0;
}

.with-padding {
    padding: 30px;
}

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <img
                        class="image-embed"
                        src="https://coursework.vschool.io/content/images/2016/08/span.png"
                        alt="Two span elements showing the effect of padding, one with no padding and one with 30px padding" />
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements are inline
                    elements, they naturally want to take up as little space as
                    possible. By default they have no padding. Once we add
                    padding, we can see that the element gets larger in the
                    amount of space it takes up on the page. The text itself
                    determines the height and width of the element, but if we
                    want to extend the size of the element further (including a
                    larger amount of space for the background color), we can use
                    padding to do this.

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Border</h3>
                <p>
                    An element's border is akin to the plastic walls of the
                    bubble suit. It represents the separation between the
                    element itself and any other elements that may be nearby.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">

}

.big-border {
    border: 10px dashed red;

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <img
                        class="image-embed"
                        src="https://coursework.vschool.io/content/images/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-17-at-8-36-13-PM.png"

                <p>
                    There are a number of things we can do with an element's
                    border, including rounding the corners, changing the border
                    style, etc. Some of the most common properties we change are
                    the <code>border-width</code>, <code>border-color</code>,
                    <code>border-style</code>, and <code>border-radius</code>.
                </p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        <code>border-width</code> is simply the thickness of the
                        border itself. In the example above, one has a
                        <code>border-width</code> of 1 px, the other 10px.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>border-color</code> is the color of the border.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>border-style</code> is the pattern of the border.
                        There are a lot of options, all of which can be found
                        <a
                            href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-style.asp"
                            target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener"
                            >here</a
                        >.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>border-radius</code> is the roundness of the
                        corners of the border (and the element itself).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You may notice from the above image that the border is
                    traced along the inside of the padding. It is important to
                    note that the border will do this by default. Even if you
                    set the item to have 0 padding, it will create the padding
                    it needs in order for the border to still be sitting inside
                    the element. So if you're trying to use percentages to do
                    math with the width of items on a page, but you're also
                    adding a border (no matter how small), your math won't work
                    out to 100%! The widths of the borders will add just enough
                    to make your items not sit side-by-side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To remedy this, you'll probably want to add the following to
                    the top of your CSS file:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This property takes the width of the border into account
                    when setting the <code>width</code> and
                    <code>height</code> properties, so now you could put 2
                    objects side-by-side at 50% each without pulling your hair
                    out!
                </p>
            </div>

            <hr class="section-divider" />

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Margin</h3>
                <p>
                    In our bubble suit analogy, an element's
                    <code>margin</code> would be the space between other people
                    who are also wearing their own bubble suits. The greater the
                    margin, the more space between each person and their suit.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
&lt;span&gt;No margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I'm squished!&lt;/span&gt;

                        looks like there is a little bit a margin separating the
                        two spans. This has to do with a quirk of HTML obeying
                        whitespace between HTML tags on separate lines, and it
                        doesn't mean that the elements have some margin. If you
                        put the two spans on the same line in the editor (<code
                            >&lt;span&gt;No margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I'm
                            squished!&lt;/span&gt;</code
                        >), you'll see that small space disappear.</em

                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's see a more realistic example of when margin should be

                <p>
                    This navbar is really cramped and each link is really small!
                    How would we make each element larger so the user didn't
                    have to be very precise with their mouse? Padding! Remember,
                    padding adds space inside the element so as to make the
                    element's insides larger:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
nav li {
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: #3B62F2;
    padding: 10px;
}

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <img
                        class="image-embed"
                        src="https://coursework.vschool.io/content/images/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-18-at-3-15-14-PM.png"
                        alt="Navbar with links enlarged using padding" />
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we wanted to move each of these links further apart from
                    one another? This is where margin comes in to play! I could
                    add <code>margin: 10px;</code> to my
                    <code>nav li</code> selector, and that would add a margin of
                    10px to all 4 sides:
                </p>

                <h3>Limitations of margin</h3>
                <p>
                    Margin shouldn't be used to lay out your page! If you want
                    something to be on the right side of your page,
                    <strong
                        >do not add <code>margin-left: 90%</code> to you
                        element!</strong
                    >
                    This is the job of the <code>position</code> property.
                    Margin should be used solely for pushing other elements
                    away, usually just by a relatively small amount.

                <h3>Another example: images and text</h3>
                <p>
                    It's common to have an image that sits inline with your
                    text. Image tags are inline elements, and text tags are
                    block-level elements, so there's a property that allows our
                    image tags to "float" next to our text. However, because it
                    is still an inline element, it will still try to take up as
                    little space as possible, resulting in this:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
&lt;img class="kitten-pic" src="http://placekitten.com/g/200/300" alt="Kitten!"&gt;&lt;div class="kitten-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a picture of a kitten. His name is Mr. Pickles, and he is the cuddliest kitten you'll ever meet. However, if you get on his bad side he will shred your skin away, and then shred your couch cushions for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's best not to get on his bad side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    The text is far too close to that kitten! Margin to the

                <h3>Shortcut properties</h3>
                <p>
                    So far we've been using the shortcut properties
                    <code>padding</code>, <code>border</code>, and
                    <code>margin</code> without explaining what they mean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of those properties have a long-form version that deals
                    with each side individually:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
/* Padding */
padding-top: 20px;
padding-right: 20px;
padding-bottom: 20px;
padding-left: 20px;

/* Border */
border-top-width: 2px;
border-right-width: 2px;
border-bottom-width: 2px;
border-left-width: 2px;
border-top-style: dashed;
... etc ...
border-top-color: blue;
... etc ...
border-top-right-radius: 20%;
... etc ...

/* Margin */
margin-top: 20px;
margin-right: 20px;
margin-bottom: 20px;
margin-left: 20px;

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    We can always use these long-form version of the properties
                    if we need a lot more flexibility, but fortunately we're
                    given the option to shorten all of these.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For padding and margin, we can decide to either put 1, 2, 3,
                    or 4 size values, separated by a space, in the
                    <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> property:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
margin: 10px;
margin: 10px 20px;
margin: 10px 20px 30px;
margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px;

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The order is important: 1) top, 2) right, 3) bottom, and 4)
                    left. With these in mind, the following rules apply:
                </p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        If you have a single value:
                        <ul class="custom-list">
                            <li>
                                Your value applies to
                                <strong>all 4 sides</strong>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you have 2 values:
                        <ul class="custom-list">
                            <li>
                                The <strong>first value</strong> applies to the
                                <strong>top and bottom</strong> sides, and
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The <strong>second value</strong> applies to the
                                <strong>right and left</strong> sides.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you have 3 values:
                        <ul class="custom-list">
                            <li>The first value applies to the top side,</li>
                            <li>
                                The second value applies to the right and left
                                sides, and
                            </li>
                            <li>The third value applies to the bottom side.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you have 4 values:
                        <ul class="custom-list">
                            <li>
                                The order of the values goes, respectively,
                                <strong>top, right, bottom, left</strong>.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Other shortcut methods follow a different pattern. With
                    borders, for example, the <code>border</code> shortcut
                    method is simply a combination of <code>border-width</code>,
                    <code>border-style</code>, and <code>border-color</code> (in
                    that order), all of which are optional:
                </p>
