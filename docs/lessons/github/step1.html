                <h3>Why Git is Important for New Developers</h3>
                <p>
                    If you’re just starting out with coding, learning Git is
                    really important. Git is a tool that helps you keep track of
                    changes in your code and work with others on the same
                    projects. Here’s why it’s so useful:
                </p>
                <ol class="custom-list">
                    <li><strong>Tracking Changes</strong></li>
                    <ul class="custom-list">
                        <li>
                            Git helps you see every change you’ve made to your
                            code. This is helpful because:
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Undo Mistakes</strong>: If you make a
                            mistake, you can go back to an earlier version of
                            your code, saving you time and frustration.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>See History</strong>: You can see who made
                            changes and what those changes were, making it
                            easier to understand the evolution of the project.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Working Together</strong></li>
                    <ul class="custom-list">
                        <li>
                            Git makes it easy for multiple people to work on the
                            same project at the same time without messing up
                            each other’s work. You can:
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Branching</strong>: Create separate branches
                            to work on new features or fixes without affecting
                            the main code. This keeps the main project stable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Merging</strong>: Combine your changes with
                            others smoothly. Git helps manage and integrate
                            these changes to avoid conflicts.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Finding and Fixing Errors</strong></li>

                        <li>
                            With Git, you can experiment with your code without
                            worrying about breaking things. If you do make a
                            mistake, Git lets you:
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Revert Changes</strong>: Go back to a
                            working version of your code easily. This helps you
                            recover quickly from mistakes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Find Problems</strong>: Use tools to see
                            what changes might have caused an error, making
                            debugging faster and easier.
