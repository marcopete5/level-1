                    Node is a powerful tool that allows Javascript to be
                    interpreted <code>outside</code> of the browser - most
                    importantly, it allows Javascript to be used as a
                    server-side language.
                </p>
                <p>What does this mean?</p>
                <p>
                    Traditionally we used a backend language (like Python, Ruby,
                    C#, Go, etc.) to retrieve and control the data from the
                    database. It was then passed to the
                    <code>front end</code> where javascript (and the browser)
                    would take over displaying the information to the end user.
                    Thus nearly every <code>back end</code> programmer had to
                    know Javascript <code>and</code> some other language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Javascript was made to use in the browser, but Node changed
                    that. A programmer could use Javascript on the
                    <code>front end</code> to display the information
                    <strong>AND</strong> use Javascript, with Node, on the
                    <code>back end</code> to get and manipulate data from the
                    data base.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Node has a vast community of contributors and a large amount
                    of packages available via the Node Package Manager (NPM).
                    Node is one of the most contributed to programs in the
                    world.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Node was built on top of the JavaScript V8 Engine, which was
                    developed by Google to run JavaScript code in the Google
                    Chrome browser. The V8 Engine is widely considered the best
                    JavaScript engine available out there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through an initiative in the open source community, the
                    power of the V8 engine was brought to the command line by
                    the creation of Node.js. Node.js is free and open-source,
                    comes with its own extensive API for interacting with your
                    machine (instead of just a browser window), and thus allows
                    developers to build a server entirely in JavaScript. Before
                    node.js, servers needed to be written in languages that were
                    already built to interact with machine code such as C#,
                    Java, Python, or Ruby (amongst many others). Now a developer
                    can write both server-side and client-side code entirely in
                    JavaScript!
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are certain requirements we need in a system in order
                    to create a web server:
                </p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        Better ways to organize our code into reusable pieces
                    </li>
                    <li>Ways to deal with files</li>
                    <li>Ways to deal with databases</li>
                    <li>Ability to communicate over the internet</li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to accept requests and send responses (in a
                        consistent and standard way)
                    </li>
                    <li>Way to deal with work that takes a long time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The creators of Node.js added APIs that allow it to
                    accomplish all of the above requirements. The full API
                    documentation can be found at
                    <a
                        href="https://nodejs.org/api/"
                        target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener"
                        >nodejs.org/api/</a
                    >. Any aspiring Node.js developer should read through the
                    Node.js documentation extensively to become familiar with
                    the tools that are available at your disposal.
