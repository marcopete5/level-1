                    The skill of debugging is an extraordinarily important one
                    to develop as a programmer. No matter how good your code is
                    or how skilled of a programmer you become, you will always
                    spend a majority of your time fixing bugs in your (or
                    someone else's) code.

                <h3>What is debugging? What are bugs?</h3>
                <p>
                    Simply put, bugs are flaws in your program. Sometimes they
                    are immediately apparent, but sometimes they can remain in a
                    system for years without being caught. Simple bugs are often
                    just programmer errors such as spelling mistakes or missing
                    curly braces. Often, however, bugs only surface when someone
                    uses your program in a way that you hadn't anticipated when
                    writing the code.

                <h3>Debugging is an art AND a science.</h3>
                <p>
                    The hard truth is - the computer does exactly what you tell
                    it to. End of story. It's science. You'll be humbled time
                    and again if you let yourself believe otherwise. When "the
                    program isn't doing what you told it to do," it's almost a
                    certainty that you've made a mistake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the computer essentially runs on science, and if
                    programming can be considered an art, then the process of
                    debugging is both an art and a science. Depending on the
                    type of bug you're encountering, you will likely have to put
                    on your think-like-a-computer hat AND your think-like-a-user
                    hat.

                <p>
                    Remember how we talked earlier in the course about the
                    importance of problem solving? Debugging is one major form
                    of problem solving programmers are expected to be good at!
                    Fortunately, since debugging makes up such a significant
                    portion of our time as programmers, there are tons of tools
                    and techniques at your disposal you can use to find and
                    squash the bugs you (or maybe someone else) has written into
                    the code.

                    Likely the biggest thing you can do to learn web development
                    faster is to use the browsers dev tools. The elements tab is
                    a great place to start.
