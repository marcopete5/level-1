                    The VSchool Discord Channels will be the primary resource
                    for asking questions about blockers, curriculum,
                    assignments, projects, concepts, or anything code related.
                    The level channels are a positive, encouraging,
                    non-judgmental, and creative place to ask any questions you
                    may have as you progress through the program.

                            Our rule of thumb is to problem solve on your own
                            for at least 30 min. but no longer than 1hr before
                            asking for help

                            making your question visible to everyone increases
                            collaboration. It also allows all those in the
                            channel to help with the problem solving process.

                            Please try and avoid Direct Messaging an Instructor

                                have similar or the exact same questions and
                                sometimes it helps to see that and possibly work
                                the blockers together or share solutions.</em
