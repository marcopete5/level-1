                <h3>1. Identify the Problem:</h3>
                <p>
                    The first step in solving any problem is to identify what
                    the problem is. Take a moment to clearly define the problem
                    you are trying to solve. Write down any details you have
                    about the problem, and consider any possible causes or
                    contributing factors.

                <p>
                    Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you can
                    begin planning your solution. Think about the steps you will
                    need to take to solve the problem, and consider any tools or
                    resources you will need to use. Sketch out your solution in
                    pseudocode, flowcharts, or other planning tools to help you
                    organize your thoughts.

//1. Greet the player - Done
//2. Collect the players name and store it in a variable - Done
//3. Ask the player to walk - Done
//4. Wild monster has the chance to appear 1/3
//5. A random enemy appears from an array of enemies
//6. The user decides whether they will run or fight
//7. If the user decides to attack a combat loop will be entered
//8. If user wins the user gets an item and bonus health
//9. If user dies the game ends and the user gets a gameover message and start new game prompt appears
//10. If the user attempts to run there will be a 50 percent chance of escape
//   if users does not escape they take damage if escape is successful user returns to run loop
//11. The user will be able to print their inventory and stats to the screen

                <p>
                    With your plan in place, you can start writing your code.
                    Take the time to write clean, well-organized code that
                    follows best practices and is easy to understand. Test your
                    code as you go, checking for any errors or bugs that may
                    arise.
