                <p>
                    Imagine you have a button that toggles a light on and off.
                    Loop through the following array of numbers and toggle the
                    button the numbers of times for each number. The array
                    <code>[2, 3, 2]</code> would toggle the button 7 times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The light is off to start with. Log to the console whether
                    or not the light is on at the end.
                </p>
                <p>Sample Arrays:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
[2, 5, 435, 4, 3] // "The light is on"
[1, 1, 1, 1, 3]   // "The light is on"
[9, 3, 4, 2]      // "The light is off"

</code></pre>

                <pre><code class="language-jsx">

For [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]: The light is on
For [9, 3, 4, 2]: The light is off

            <div class="section">
                <h3>A bigger picture:</h3>
                <p>
                    Your friends list, ingredients on a cooking website, posts
                    on a feed, and just about every list is an array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will want to be able to "iterate" over these arrays to
                    inspect them, paint them to the DOM, or automate tedious
                    processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look forward to Level 2, where you'll learn about iterator
                    methods like <code>.map()</code> and <code>.filter()</code>.
                    These array methods will run for loops for you. That's if
                    you give them a callback function as an argument. This
                    function will run for every item in the array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>.map()</code> will run a for loop that will help you
                    create all your news feeds, lists, and anything online
                    that's plural in React.

                <p>
                    A common pattern in code challenges will be to define a
                    variable and assign it an "empty" value before your for
                    loop. You then use the for loop to control it and then log
                    or return the variable after you've looped through your
                    array.

                <p><code>let count = 0</code></p>

                <p><code>const codes = []</code></p>
