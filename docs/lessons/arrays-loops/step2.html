                <h3>What is a loop?</h3>
                <p>
                    Any time you find yourself needing to repeat the same code
                    over and over, you'll oftentimes need a loop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine you're tasked with <code>console.log</code>ging the
                    numbers 1 through 1,000 to the console. Obviously this would
                    be <em>very</em> obnoxious and repetitive to write manually.
                    But still possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a more complex example, imagine you're given an array of
                    email addresses, and you need to write a program that will
                    send out an email to each address. You might not know ahead
                    of time which email addresses will be in the array, which
                    actually makes it impossible to write the program
                    dynamically to accept any array of email addresses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>tl;dr:</strong> loops are <em>real</em> important to
                    understand, and you'll be using them <em>all the time</em>!

            <div class="section">
                <h3>for loop</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the easiest ways to think about a for loop is to
                    think of it as a glorified way of counting. You pick a
                    number to start at (very commonly <code>0</code>) and tell
                    it how high you want to count. Inside the for loop, you have
                    access to the current count you're at.
                </p>
                <p>Counting to 1,000? Instead of:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">console.log(0)
console.log(1)
console.log(2)
console.killmenow...
</code></pre>
                <p>Use a <code>for</code> loop!</p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">for (var i = 0; i <= 1000; i++){
    console.log(i);
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Notice that all we're doing is logging the variable
                    <code>i</code>? Essentially the for loop is just keeping a
                    count for us with the variable <code>i</code>. In order to
                    understand how that works, we need to understand each part
                    of the code in the parentheses of the loop.
                </p>
                <h4>Anatomy of a for loop:</h4>
                <p>
                    Inside the parentheses of the for loop you have 3 parts. In
                    the example above, theres:
                </p>
                <ol class="custom-list">
                    <li><code>var i = 0;</code>,</li>
                    <li><code>i <= 1000</code>, and</li>
                    <li><code>i++</code></li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Section 1 - Initializing variables</h4>
                <p>
                    The first section is where you initialize any variables
                    you'll need during the for loop. Typically you'll just
                    create a variable called <code>i</code> (as a convention;
                    there's nothing special about that variable name) and set it
                    equal to <code>0</code>.
                </p>
                <h4>Section 2 - "Should I run again?" conditional</h4>
                <p>
                    The second section is a conditional statement that
                    determines if the loop should run one more time. In the
                    example above, it asks itself "is <code>i</code> still less
                    than or equal to <code>1000</code>? Yes? Okay, I'll run the
                    code again one more time!" As soon as the conditional
                    evaluates to <code>false</code>, the loop will stop running.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Section 3 - Code to run right before checking the
                    conditional in section 2
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The last section is a set of code to run right before
                    checking to see if the loop should run again. You can think
                    of it as a bit of code that should always be included at the
                    very end of the <code>for</code> loop's code.
                    <code>i++</code> increments <code>i</code> by 1, thereby
                    bringing it closer to the conditional in section 2
                    evaluating to <code>false</code>.
                </p>
                <aside>
                    <p>
                        Note: You'll <em>always</em> want to make sure your
                        conditional is getting closer to evaluating to
                        <code>false</code>. What would happen if your for loop's
                        signature (the first line of the for loop) looked like
                        this: <code>for (var i = 0; i > -1; i++)</code>? If
                        <code>i</code> is <em>always</em> great than -1 and
                        we're making it get further and further away from -1,
                        the loop will never end! This is called an "infinite
                        loop".
                    </p>

                <h4>for loops with arrays</h4>
                <p>
                    Remember learning how each item in an array has an index
                    number that tells you where in the array that item is? The
                    very first item in the array is at index 0, the second item
                    at index 1, and so forth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember how you can access an item in an array by its index
                    with square brackets after the array's variable name? Like
                    so:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">var favoriteThings = ["Raindrops on roses", "Whiskers on kittens", "Bright copper kettles", "Warm woollen mittens"]

console.log(favoriteThings[0])  // logs "Raindrops on roses"
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    What if you wanted to do something to every item in the
                    array, say <code>console.log</code> it? Just like the
                    counting to 1,000 example above, you could do:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">console.log(favoriteThings[0]);
console.log(favoriteThings[1]);
console.log(favoriteThings[2]);
console.log(favoriteThings[3]);
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    But then if you include ALL of your favorite things (14
                    things according to the song), you'd need 14 lines of code!
                    And notice the only thing that has changed between lines is
                    the index number? And notice we're just starting from the
                    beginning and moving to the end of the array? If you
                    manually wrote each of those lines and then added things to
                    your array, you'd <em>also</em> need to add lines to your
                    console logs... it all stinks of poor design. Let's use a
                    <code>for</code> loop to do something to every item in the
                    array!
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    console.log(favoriteThings[i]);
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The variable <code>i</code> starts at 0 and goes up to 3
                    before the loop stops. Each time through the loop, it runs
                    <code>console.log(favoriteThings[i])</code>, the computer
                    evaluates <code>i</code> and uses it as the index of the
                    item in the array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's a problem though. If we add items into the array,
                    our loop is still set up to only get the first 4 items
                    because hard-coded the <code>i < 4</code> part into the for
                    loop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, let's use the array's <code>.length</code> property
                    to determine how many times the loop should run:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">for (var i = 0; i < favoriteThings.length; i++) {
    console.log(favoriteThings[i]);
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Now if we ever added an item to <code>favoriteThings</code>,
                    the loop would run the correct number of times!
                </p>

                <p>
                    A <code>while</code> loop does something very similar to a
                    <code>for</code> loop, in that it's job is to run lines of
                    code over and over. The main difference, however, is that
                    instead of running the code a pre-determined number of times
                    (e.g. once for every item in an array), it runs an
                    indeterminite number of times until the condition evaluates
                    to <code>false</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, imagine you prompt a user to indicate whether
                    they like raisins or not. You need them to either type "yes"
                    or "no", and no other input will work. You could write a
                    loop to ensure the user can't move forward in your program
                    unless they type "yes" or "no" with a
                    <code>while</code> loop:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">var likesRaisins = prompt("Do you like raisins? Type 'yes' or 'no':");

while(likesRaisins !== "yes" || likesRaisins !== "no"){
    likesRaisins = prompt("Please only type 'yes' or 'no'. Do you like raisins?");
}

console.log("You said '" + likesRaisins + "' to my question.")
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This way you can rest assured that you will have a valid
                    answer in the code after your while loop. If the user inputs
                    an invalid answer, the loop will get them stuck forever.

                        >We don't know how long they'll be stuck answering

                <h3>Tools to use in loops</h3>
                <h4>break</h4>
                <p>
                    <code>break</code> is a reserved keyword that ends the loop
                    early. Say you're checking an array to see if it contains
                    even a single <code>true</code> as one of its items (and
                    pretend you haven't learned about <code>indexOf</code> yet).
                    You decide to loop through it checking for
                    <code>true</code>:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === true) {
        console.log("We found a true!");
        break;
    }
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em>As soon as you find a <code>true</code></em
                    >, you can break out of the loop. No need to continue
                    through the loop since you found what you were looking for.
                </p>
                <h4>continue</h4>
                <p>
                    <code>continue</code> is also a reserved keyword that will
                    skip the rest of the current iteration and go to the next
                    iteration, but doesn't stop the loop like
                    <code>break</code> does.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine you want to count to 10. But when you were in the
                    7th grade you came to school on Halloween in a Ghostbuster's
                    costume only to discover, to your horror,
                    <strong>no one else had dressed up!</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever since, you've hated the number 7. As such, when
                    counting to 10, you want to just skip 7 altogether.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">for (var i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i === 7) {
        continue;
    }
    console.log(i);
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    If <code>i</code> is 7, the program says "uhh, don't run any
                    of this code this time, just <em>continue</em> to the next
                    time through the loop."
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Loops are an extremely useful tool that you'll find yourself
                    using <em>all the time</em> in programming. They're usually
                    one of the first difficult concepts programmers face, but
                    the more you play with them, the better you'll understand
                    them. Don't give up!
