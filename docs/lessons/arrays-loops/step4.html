                    Nested loops are a very useful tool that we have access to
                    in JavaScript. They can be used for a variety of things,
                    such as accessing/creating matrices, or building a game
                    similar to Battleship using a grid like system.

                <h3>Multidimensional Arrays</h3>
                <p>
                    We refer to arrays inside of arrays as "Multidimensional
                    Arrays." People might also call them "Nested arrays."
                    Specifically, two layers deep is a "Two Dimensional Array,"
                    three layers deep is a "Three Dimensional Array."

                <h3>Uses</h3>
                <p>First, let's take a look at our array</p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">var arr = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]];
</code></pre>
                <p>It's easier if we look at it like this</p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">// the variable arr is an array full of arrays
var arr = [
    [1,2], // &lt;-- this is an array
    [3,4], // &lt;-- this is an array
    [5,6]  // &lt;-- this is an array
];
</code></pre>
                <p>Now let's look at the first for loop</p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">for (var i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++){
    console.log(arr[i])
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    We are console logging <code>arr[i]</code>,
                    <code>i</code> starts at a value of <code>0</code> and
                    increments 1 each round through the loop.
                </p>
                <p>Therefore our console will look like this</p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">[1,2] // arr[0] or the first time through the loop
[3,4] // arr[1] or 2nd loop
[5,6] // arr[2] or 3rd loop
</code></pre>
                <p>Let's do the nested loop now</p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">for (var i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++){
    for (var j = 0; j &lt; arr[i].length; j++){
        console.log(arr[i][j]);
    }
}
</code></pre>
                <p>The console.log here will print out like this</p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">//I listed below next to each number what arr[i][j] will actually look like each round through the for loops.

1 // arr[0][0]
2 // arr[0][1]
3 // arr[1][0]
4 // arr[1][1]
5 // arr[2][0]
6 // arr[2][1]

                <h3>Warning</h3>
                <p>
                    Nested loops are often considered dangerous. They are fine
                    on a small scale, but let's pretend we have an app with
                    users and each of the users can favorite other user's
                    profiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wouldn't want to write a nested loop that looped through
                    all our users, and each time it did that, looped through the
                    users again to see if that user had favorited any other
                    user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This operation would perform fairly quick if we just had 10
                    users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would loop through each user, and on each user it would
                    loop 10 times to check that user against each of the others.
                    Meaning the loop would run 100 times
                </p>
                <p>
                    But if we had 1,000 users, that would be 1,000,000 checks.
                    This operation would become exponentially slower the more
                    users we get. This is part of the Big O discussion, but
                    that's all we'll mention here.
