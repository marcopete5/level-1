                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the Web Development Program! Whether you're
                    joining us online or in person, we're excited to embark on
                    this journey with you. In Level 1, you'll be introduced to
                    fundamental concepts that form the backbone of web
                    development. These include <code>HTML</code>,
                    <code>CSS</code>, and <code>JS</code>, more specifically
                    <code>Javascript</code> functionality. Level 1 focuses on
                    Loops and Logic. This is the concept of looping through our
                    data in some way and providing logic to that data. (For
                    Loops/ While Loops/ If Else statements) By mastering these
                    concepts, you'll build a strong foundation that will serve
                    you well throughout your web development journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you progress through Level 1, don't forget to check out
                    our live demo of the Capstone project you'll be building for
                    your final project. This project will encapsulate everything
                    you've learned and allow you to showcase your skills as a
                    budding web developer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Complete the coursework. These lessons and assignments are
                    meant to be completed in a specific order to teach you the
                    right amount of material at the right times. Some students
                    lament that they didn't know <code>CSS Flex</code> and
                    <code>CSS Grid</code> earlier, so some skipping around may
                    be acceptable.

                <p>
                    Level 1 is a journey! You'll do best if you make friends,
                    tire yourself out on the journey every day, and take time to
                    appreciate how far you've come along the way. If you're on
                    it, you'll have found a crew and you'll be ready for the
                    next adventure, and it will only take a few weeks.
