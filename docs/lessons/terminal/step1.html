                <h3>What is the terminal?</h3>
                <p>
                    When launched, it provides a line interface to control the
                    underpinnings of the UNIX-based operating system. In short,
                    it lets you control your computer like hackers from the
                    movies!

                <h3>Why use it?</h3>
                <p>
                    Until now, you've been used to using a mouse and monitor to
                    interact with your computer. However, some systems you'll
                    want to use don't have a graphical user interface and many
                    of the applications you will use in this class are only run
                    (or better run) via the terminal.

                <h3>What can I do with the terminal?</h3>
                <p>
                    There's a lot you can do with it! You can create files,
                    delete them, make folders, run applications, and perform
                    complex operations all via the command line. Here are some
                    examples of a few:
                </p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        <code>pwd</code> tells you what directory you are
                        currently in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>ls</code> lists the files and folders in the
                        current directory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>cd</code> changes what directory you're in. You
                        can use <code>/</code> to get to the root directory
                        quickly.

                        <code>mkdir</code> makes a new folder in the current
                        directory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>touch</code> creates a new file with the name and

                    <li>
                        <code>rm</code> deletes a file or folder. Use it with -r
                        to force it to delete a folder even if there are still
                        objects in the folder you are trying to delete.

                    <li>
                        <code>mv</code> either <em>moves</em> or

                        use it

                    <ul class="custom-list">
                        <li>
                            To <em>rename</em> a file, you would do
                            <code

                            <code>&gt;</code>. For example:
                        </li>

                    <li>
                        To move a file or folder to another directory, you would

                        <code

                    <li>
                        <code>cp -r [new directory name]</code> will copy a

                    <li>
                        <code>nano</code> will open the nano text editor. If we
                        say <code>nano [file that already exists]</code> we will
                        be editing that file, but if we say
                        <code>nano [new file that doesn't exist yet]</code> we
                        will create a new file and start editing it.

                            At the bottom of Nano, we can see that if we hold
                            down control and push "x" we will exit. While we
                            exit, it asks us to push <code>y</code> to save, and
                            then <code>enter</code> to confirm the file name.

                <h3>What complex operations can one do in the terminal?</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that you know how to do some of the most basic
                    operations in the terminal, you are prepared to deal with
                    more complex programs like Git, SSH-ing into a server,
                    editing files directly in terminal, etc. Another great
                    resource that is best accessed through the terminal is
                    called a package manager. In this class you will learn to
                    use <code>NPM</code>, which is a package manager that will
                    give you access to powerful tools to use within your own
                    work.
