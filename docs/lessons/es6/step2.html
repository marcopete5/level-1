                <p>
                    Constructor functions are one of the most useful pieces of
                    JavaScript you'll use, and they're prominent in just about
                    every library and framework you'll interact with in one way
                    or another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Constructor functions (and classes, in Object-Oriented
                    languages) act like
                    <strong>blueprints for creating objects</strong>. It gives
                    you the ability to define the structure for an object once,
                    and use it as a template for creating new objects in the
                    future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many times they are compared to blueprints for a house. A
                    home builder will oftentimes use the same set of blueprints
                    to build the basic structure of many houses, and then alter
                    the characteristics of each home (paint color, carpeting or
                    hardwood floors, and perhaps even some smaller structural
                    changes) individually, after the main structure is built.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, in JavaScript we can use a constructor function
                    to be the main outline of our objects, and change the
                    characteristics of the objects it creates.
                </p>
            </div>

            <hr class="section-divider" />

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Example: A Social Media website</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's say you want to create a new social media website, and
                    the time has come to define what data you want to collect
                    from your users. In your code, you need a way to accept
                    input from a user and create a new <code>user</code> object
                    for every person who signs up for your site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every object will be similar in the properties it needs: you
                    want to collect their first name, last name, age, favorite
                    movie, and favorite sport, if they decide to enter it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words, you're planning on having millions of
                    objects stored in the database that all look pretty similar:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
{
    firstName: &lt;"user first name here"&gt;,
    lastName: &lt;"user last name here"&gt;,
    age: &lt;user age here&gt;,
    favoriteMovie: &lt;"user favorite movie here"&gt;,
    favoriteSport: &lt;"user favorite sport here, if entered"&gt;
}

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Notice how the structure of this object is pretty much
                    decided already? It's just missing the values, waiting for
                    the user to enter their information so the object can be
                    created and saved to the database. This is the ideal time to
                    use a constructor!

                <h3>The Anatomy of a Function Constructor</h3>
                <p>
                    As previously mentioned, a function constructor is a
                    JavaScript function, but with a few tweaks to the way we use
                    them normally. Check out the constructor for our
                    <code>user</code> objects:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
function User(fName, lName, age, favMovie, favSport) {
    this.firstName = fName;
    this.lastName = lName;
    this.age = age;
    this.favoriteMovie = favMovie;
    this.favoriteSport = favSport;
}

</code></pre>
                <p>A couple things may stick out right away:</p>
                <ol class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        The function begins with a capital letter. This isn't
                        strictly required for the constructor to work properly,
                        but it is the widely-adopted convention and should
                        always be followed.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <code>this</code> keyword is everywhere!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Remember how the constructor is a "blueprint" for creating
                    objects? Also remember that we can access an object's
                    property by using the <code>.</code> (dot) syntax?
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
var person = {name: "Jim"};
console.log(person.name);

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The problem is we don't want to assign a permanent variable
                    name for every single user that gets created, nor could we
                    really do so if we wanted. (Short of altering the web
                    application's code, manually adding a new object for every
                    single user that signs up... <em>obviously</em> out of the
                    question.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>this</code> keyword allows us to refer dynamically
                    to
                    <em
                        >whichever object is being created with this constructor
                        function</em
                    >. In other words, it allows us to add properties and
                    methods to any object that gets instantiated with this
                    constructor.
                </p>

                <h3>Using the constructor</h3>
                <p>
                    To use the constructor we need to use JavaScript's
                    <code>new</code> keyword, and pass in the actual data we
                    want to save to the user object:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
var newUser = new User("Joe", "Schmoe", 42, "Ernest Goes to Camp", "UFC");

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <code>newUser</code> now has all the properties I want my
                    user objects to have, and all the values that were
                    (supposedly) entered by the user. (In the above example,
                    they're hard-coded in for simplicity's sake).
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if I wanted to create 100 new objects and save them all
                    to an array?
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
var objectArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
    var newObj = new User("Joe", "Schmoe", 42, "Ernest Goes to Camp", "UFC");
    objectArray.push(newObj);
}

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    That's it! Of course, all of those objects are identical
                    which is pretty useless, but it should illustrate the power
                    of the function constructor.
                </p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    We aren't limited to adding just properties to our objects
                    in a constructor, we can add methods as well:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
function User(fName, lName, age, favMovie, favSport) {
    ...
    this.speak = function() {
        console.log("Hi! My name is " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " and my favorite movie is " + this.favoriteMovie);
    }
}

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    We can access the other properties of the same constructor
                    by also using <code>this.propertyName</code>. If I create a
                    new <code>User</code>, I can run the
                    <code>speak()</code> method of the user and the output will
                    be specific to that one user.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
var jill = new User("Jill", "Hill", 12, "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Climbing");
jill.speak();  // prints "Hi! My name is Jill Hill and my favorite movie is Jack and the Beanstalk".

                <h3>Caveat: prototypes</h3>
                <p>
                    The above way of adding methods to objects in a constructor
                    is generally considered to be bad practice. It is better to
                    instead add the methods to the <code>prototype</code> of the
                    constructor. This is mostly for performance reasons as the
                    speak method will be duplicated for each new object, which
                    is redundant. Check out our writeup on

                    for a complete explanation. But as a quick reference, this
                    is how you would do that:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
function User(fName, lName, age, favMovie, favSport) {
    this.firstName = fName;
    ...
    }
}

User.prototype.speak = function() {
        console.log("Hi! My name is " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " and my favorite movie is " + this.favoriteMovie);
}

var jill = new User("Jill", "Hill", 12, "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Climbing");
jill.speak();  // Still prints "Hi! My name is Jill Hill and my favorite movie is Jack and the Beanstalk".

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    There is a lot more to learn about constructors, and
                    understanding when it's best to use them takes time and
                    experience. But for now you should have enough knowledge to
                    start practicing with them and using them in your everyday
                    code!
