                    Write a game that lets a user escape a room. The character
                    finds him/herself locked in a room. In order to escape the
                    room, your character needs to find the key in the room and
                    then open the door. There's also a hole in the wall in the
                    room. If your character puts his hand in the hole, he dies.
                </p>
                <h3>Game start:</h3>
                <p>Tell the user their options:</p>

                    <li>Find the key, or</li>
                    <li>Put hand in hole</li>
                    <li>Open the door</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    They can't open the door unless they find the key first.
                    They die if they put their hand in the hole.

                <h3>Problem solving approach:</h3>
                <p>
                    Attempt this assignment using just the requirements above.
                    If you get stumped, it's ok to read through the following
                    tips. Attempt the problems solving process by yourself
                    first! It's the best way to get better at it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may find yourself asking where to start. This program
                    will need to ask the user a question over and over. Because
                    of this, we will need a loop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program will ask the same question, but respond in
                    different ways depending on things that vary. Before our
                    loop, we may need to define a couple variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't want to give away the whole assignment, but imagine
                    we were interested in counting how many times the user was
                    asked a question. We could define <code>count</code> and set
                    it to 0. What variables would you want to define before the
                    for loop for the requirements of this assignment?
                </p>
                <p>
                    These variables will toggle. What data type would be good
                    for a toggle?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make sure you know the difference between the assignment
                    operator <code>=</code> and the "is equal to" operators,
                    <code>==</code> and <code>===</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will use if statements, and likely nested if statements
                    to solve this code challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    console.logs are a must!! Make sure you know what lines in
                    what order will run when the user (you, as the tester) does
                    different things. Console.logs will confirm what you know,
                    or show you where you're thinking about things wrong. You
                    may need a friend to talk it through, but the console will
                    get you in the right direction!
                </p>
