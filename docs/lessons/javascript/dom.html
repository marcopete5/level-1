                    DOM manipulation is it's own beast. Fairly soon, you'll be
                    doing a lot of it along side of other things that are
                    conceptually difficult if you're not yet familiar with DOM
                    manipulation.

                    This exercise is designed to help use repetition to become
                    comfortable with syntax that is commonly used throughout the
                    industry. Each step should be a stretch, but feel free to
                    use what you learned from the last step to be able to
                    complete the next.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please take your time, and really understand why you're
                    using the code you are using.

                <h3>Bronze</h3>
                <p>
                    Your first task is to use pure JavaScript to insert a header
                    to the top of this page. It should look like this:
                </p>
                <img
                    class="image-embed"
                    src="https://coursework.vschool.io/content/images/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-15-at-4.44.53-PM.png"
                    alt="Example of header with name in different color"
                    aria-label="Example of header with name in different color for DOM Manipulation Olympics" />
                <p>
                    The HTML for the header's container exists but the header
                    and the name don't exist yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to change <code>.style</code> or use
                    <code>.name</code> or <code>.header</code> classes from the
                    CSS file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice that your name needs to be a different color.
                    Wrapping text in a <code>span</code> tag is a great way to
                    do this.

                    <li>
                        Write some JavaScript that will wait until the user
