                <p>
                    In JavaScript, having correct <strong>syntax</strong> means
                    you're obeying the basic rules that allow JavaScript to be
                    interpreted correctly. If you mess up and write incorrect
                    syntax, your program will break.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Code conventions are a little different than syntax though.
                    <strong>Conventions</strong> are like the writing/style
                    guides of programming languages. Most languages have a
                    standard convention that all programmers should follow.
                    Although your code may not necessarily <em>break</em> if you
                    don't follow convention, your fellow programmers may decide
                    they want to break <em>you</em> because you're making their
                    life more difficult...

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>
                    The following are some important conventions and best
                    practices to follow with the JavaScript language, some of
                    which apply to programming in general.
                </p>
                <h4>camelCase</h4>
                <p>
                    JavaScript uses a variable- and function-naming convention
                    called <strong>"camelCase"</strong>. This means that anytime
                    you're naming a variable or a function in your code, you
                    separate the "words" of your variable or function name by
                    capitalizing the first letter of each new "word."
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
var thisIsHowYouDoCamelCasing = true;

function hereIsAFunction() {
    ...
}
            </code></pre>
                <p>
                    You'll notice also that the first letter of the variable or
                    function is lowercased. This is also a convention, although
                    there are instances in JavaScript where it is more common to
                    capitalize this first letter, like when using a
                    <strong>constructor function</strong>. Don't worry about
                    this too much right now, but just for the sake of
                    completeness, here is an example:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name
}

Person.prototype.talk = function () {
    console.log("Hello!");
}
            </code></pre>
                <h4>Whitespace</h4>
                <p>
                    JavaScript ignores whitespace, which means you could write
                    your entire JavaScript program on a single line and it would
                    work just the same as if you spaced it out in a more
                    readable way. Since it's nearly impossible to write a
                    program this way, much less <em>read</em> a program like
                    this, you should do everything you can to make sure your
                    JavaScript is clearly and logically
                    <strong>indented</strong>. At V School we use a 4-space
                    indenting convention, although it is also very common to see
                    a 2-space convention.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
// This is legit, with 4-space indents:
if (programmerIsNoob) {
    if (notIndentedWell) {
        console.log("Fix your spacing!");
    }
}

// This is terrible awful no good, but it will technically still work:
var terribleSpacing; terribleSpacing = " "; if (terribleSpacing){ console.log("Oh heck naw"); }
            </code></pre>
                <p>
                    You should put spaces between operations in an expression.
                    So any time you have a <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>,
                    <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code>,
                    <code>=</code>, <code>===</code>, etc. you should put spaces
                    on either side:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
// Good:
var prettySum = 4 + 3 / (5 - 1)

// Not as good:
var uglySum=4+3/(5-1)
            </code></pre>
                <p>
                    You should put each property of an object on its own line,
                    and indented:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
var person = {
   name: "Bob",
   age: 21
}
            </code></pre>
                <p>
                    Right from the beginning you should be thinking about
                    writing your programs for other developers (and your future
                    self) to read. Although you may take notes in poor
                    handwriting, it's no fun if you can barely read it later on
                    when you need it!
                </p>
                <h4>Semicolons</h4>
                <p>
                    Semicolons can be confusing in JavaScript. The problem is
                    worsened by the fact that JavaScript interpreters do a
                    pretty good job of running correctly even if there are
                    missing semicolons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basic rule is that you should use them after every
                    simple statements:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
var values = ["Volvo", "Saab", "Fiat"];

var person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 50,
    eyeColor: "blue"
};
            </code></pre>
                <p>
                    You <em>won't</em> put semicolons after the closing braces
                    (<code>}</code>) of conditional (<code>if-else</code>)
                    statements, <code>for</code> loops, or
                    <code>function</code> declarations, but you will still put
                    them at the end of every simple statement therein:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
if (time < 20) {
    greeting = "Good day";
} else {
    greeting = "Good evening";
}  // No semicolon

for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    x += i;
}  // No semicolon

function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
    return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
}  // No semicolon
            </code></pre>
                <h4>Braces</h4>
                <p>
                    If there's a hotly disputed topic in programming, this might
                    be it: put the opening curly brace (<code>{</code>) on its
                    own line, or no?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The correct answer in JavaScript is <strong>no</strong>. Put
                    it at the end of the line before opening the body of the
                    block you're writing:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
// Good:
if (condition) {
    doThing();
} else {
    doAnotherThing();
}

// Bad:
if (condition)
{
    doThing();
}
else
{
    doAnotherThing();
}
            </code></pre>
                <h4>Naming</h4>
                <p>
                    Sure, you may feel like you're in a hurry to finish up the
                    program you're working on, and it's <em>way</em> easier to
                    just call that variable <code>b</code>. You know, short for
                    <code>books</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Don't do it!</strong> Just spend the extra time to
                    make the extra keystrokes it takes to type out
                    <code>books</code>! First of all - you likely won't be
                    saving much time when you introduce a new variable
                    <code>b2</code> which is short for <code>blankets</code> or
                    something, and then you have to spend a whole lot of extra
                    mental capacity remembering which one is <code>b</code> and
                    which one is <code>b2</code>. And all those bugs that will
                    ensue... it's simply not worth it. Second of all - most text
                    editors you'll be using will have code completion built-in.
                    So you won't even need to type out the whole word every time
                    anyway. You start typing it, it suggests all the names you
                    might be meaning to type, and you hit enter on the right
                    one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along those lines, we'd also recommend not shortening
                    variables by removing a bunch of letters in the middle,
                    vowels, etc. Use the variable name <code>person</code>, not
                    <code>prsn</code>. For all you know, someone later might
                    think it's short for <code>prison</code> or something
                    equally confusing.
                </p>

                        the value it represents (e.g:
                        <code>var age = 10;</code>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>String</code></strong> - same as above
                        (e.g: <code>var location = "Salt Lake City";</code>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>Boolean</code></strong> - asks a yes/no
                        question (e.g:
                        <code>var isTheRealSlimShady = true;</code>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>Function</code></strong> - verb or action
                        word/phrase describing its job (e.g:
                        <code
                            >var capitalize = function(str){ return

                    <li>
                        <strong><code>Array</code></strong> -
                        <em>Plural</em> word describing its contents (e.g:
                        <code
                            >var instruments = ["guitar", "drums", "bass",
                            "keyboard"];</code
                        >).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>Object</code></strong> -
                        <em>Singular</em> word describing what it represents
                        (e.g: <code>var animal = {type: "cow"}</code>).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Comments</h4>
                <p>
                    There are line comments (as you've seen in all the examples
                    above, beginning with <code>//</code>), and there are block
                    comments:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
/*Everything in here is a comment,
even if it goes on multiple lines*/
            </code></pre>
                <p>
                    You should mostly only be using block comments as
                    explanatory documentation for particularly complex files or
                    functions. Usually you'll want to stick to single line
                    comments for most of what you do. If your function is so
                    complex that it requires a block comment, you should
                    probably consider splitting it into multiple functions or
                    writing it more concisely.

                    You should strive to write "self-documenting code." If you
                    follow the naming conventions outlined above, you'll be well
                    on your way to writing code that is easy enough to read on
                    its own that you don't need to load it up with explanations
                    on why you're doing something a certain way.

                    Line comments are most helpful when you had to solve a
                    problem in a less-than-obvious way because of the
                    limitations you're facing. In other words, when another
                    programmer might look at your code and say "why did they do
                    it this way? I'm going to change it back...", you may want
                    to add a comment saying in effect "hey buddy - this is the
                    reason I had to do it this less-than-obvious way. If you
                    change it back you'll likely come to the same conclusion I
                    did and have to backtrack to writing it this way again."

                <h3>HTML, UNIX, etc.</h3>
                <p>
                    This is kind of cheating, since this is supposed to be all
                    about JavaScript code conventions, but it's important so
                    we'll mention it here
                </p>
                <h4>HTML tags</h4>
                <p>
                    These should always be all lowercase. Sometimes in tutorials
                    online you'll see something like <code>&lt;DIV&gt;</code>,
                    especially when using JavaScript to create HTML. Don't do
                    it! The only thing that should be capitalized in HTML is the
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> "tag" at the very top, and the
                    actual text that you're wanting to display on the screen.
                </p>
                <h4>UNIX files and folders</h4>
                <p>
                    These should always be all lowercase. Mac OSX does capital
                    letters for their system and built-in folders, but you're
                    not the Mac OSX. Since we'll be doing so much of our work in
                    the terminal and you'll have to type out the names of the
                    directories when you reference them, you'll
                    <em>almost always</em> want to have them be in all lower
                    case letters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To separate words in the name of a folder you can either use
                    the <code>_</code> or the <code>-</code> (E.g.:
                    <code>vschool_projects</code> or
                    <code>vschool-projects</code>)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Writing your code within the guidelines of convention may
                    seem odd at first, but once you've been programming for a
                    while you'll quickly understand the benefits of adhering to
                    convention. You should begin adopting these practices
                    <em>now</em> into your code, and keep in mind that employers
                    might be looking at your code when determining if you'd be a
                    good fit for their team. If you give them a reason to think
                    they'll need to educate you on following basic conventions,
                    that may be a reason they choose someone else over you.
