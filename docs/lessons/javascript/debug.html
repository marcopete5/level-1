                <ol class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Address Console Errors</strong>
                        <p>Start by tackling any console errors that appear.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If you encounter a
                            <code>TypeError</code> mentioning
                            <code>undefined is not a function</code>, inspect
                            the code around that error and determine which
                            object or function is undefined. Investigate why
                            it's undefined and fix the issue.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Explore the <code>sources</code> Tab</strong>
                        <p>
                            If there are no immediate console errors, navigate
                            to the <code>sources</code> tab in your browser's
                            developer tools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> Within the
                            <code>sources</code> tab, locate the JavaScript file
                            that's likely involved in the issue. Inspect the
                            code and identify the function responsible for
                            executing when the "Add new item" button is clicked.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Set Breakpoints</strong>
                        <p>
                            Instead of using multiple
                            <code>console.log</code> statements, utilize
                            breakpoints to pause code execution at specific
                            lines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If you suspect a
                            particular function isn't being called, set a
                            breakpoint by clicking the line number where the
                            function is defined. This will pause execution,
                            allowing you to inspect variables and values.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Independent Troubleshooting</strong>
                        <p>
                            After setting breakpoints, trigger the action that
                            should invoke the function. The browser will pause
                            at the breakpoint, giving you a chance to assess the
                            situation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If the breakpoint is set
                            within a function that's supposed to run when a
                            button is clicked, click the button and observe
                            whether the browser stops at the breakpoint.
                            Investigate any code issues that may be preventing
                            the function from executing as expected.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Code Correction and Iteration</strong>
                        <p>
                            Attempt to identify and fix the issue on your own by
                            analyzing the code and applying your understanding
                            of programming concepts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If you suspect a typo or
                            syntax error is causing the issue, correct it. If a
                            function parameter is incorrect, make necessary
                            adjustments.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Collaboration and Asking for Help</strong>
                        <p>
                            If your individual troubleshooting efforts aren't
                            yielding results, don't hesitate to ask for
                            assistance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> Collaborating with peers
                            or seeking guidance from instructors can provide
                            fresh perspectives and help overcome challenges.

                        <strong>Handling Property Errors</strong>
                        <p>
                            If you encounter errors related to properties not
                            being found, it often means you're trying to access
                            a property on an undefined object.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If you see a
                            <code
                                >Cannot read property 'name' of undefined</code
                            >
                            error, review the code leading up to this error.
                            Verify that the object you're trying to access
                            actually exists and has the expected structure.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong
                            >Inspecting Objects with
                            <code>console.dir()</code></strong
                        >
                        <p>
                            Use the <code>console.dir()</code> function to print
                            the properties and values of objects to the console,
                            allowing you to inspect their structure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If you're unsure about the
                            contents of an object, add a line like
                            <code>console.dir(myObject)</code> to your code to
                            see its properties and values in the console.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Using Conditional Breakpoints</strong>
                        <p>
                            Set breakpoints with conditions to pause execution
                            only when specific conditions are met.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If you suspect that a loop
                            is causing an issue after a certain number of
                            iterations, set a breakpoint within the loop with a
                            condition like <code>i === 10</code> to pause
                            execution when <code>i</code> reaches 10.
                        </p>

                                    If no console errors are evident, switch to
                                    the <code>sources</code> tab. Find the
                                    JavaScript file connected to the issue and
                                    locate the function responsible for handling
                                    the "Add new item" button click.

                                    Instead of using <code>console.log</code>,
                                    set breakpoints to halt code execution at
                                    crucial points. This enables you to inspect
                                    variables and values.
