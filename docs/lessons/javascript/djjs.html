                <p>
                    You're starting your business as a strictly online DJ (DJ
                    JS) and you want to start by creating a website where people
                    can change the color of a square on the page by interacting
                    with different HTML Events.
                </p>
                <p>The square's color will change as follows:</p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>Blue when the mouse hovers over the square</li>
                    <li>
                        Red when the mouse button is held down over the square
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Yellow when the mouse button is let go over the square
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Green when the mouse is double clicked in the square
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Orange when the mouse scroll is used somewhere in the
                        window (not just over the square).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You should also be able to press the first letter of the
                        colors (typing "r" on the keyboard for "red", for
                        example) and have the box change to that color. Check
                        out the key and keyCode property of
                        <code>e.target</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Attempt these requirements. If you become discouraged,
                    included are things to consider.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take a minute to think through how you would implement all
                    of these event listeners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will need a different event for each event. Keyboard
                    events are triggered by any key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>.addEventListener</code> will be called on your square
                    6 times.
                </p>
                <aside>
                    <p>
                        üí° the scroll event will only fire the it‚Äôs if there is
                        enough content to scroll. Try ‚Äúwheel‚Äù!
